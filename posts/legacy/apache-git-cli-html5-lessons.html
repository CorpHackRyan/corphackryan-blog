    <h2>Apache Setup Notes, Git CLI Practice, and HTML5 Lessons</h2>
    <p>Continuing on here from the previous post as I had to step aside for a moment:

        Need to set permissions in my home directory to -la for 600 and 700. I will probably need to revisit with my
        mentor again.
        Now that we've got documentRoot set for apache, it's time to make routine use of Git from the CLI. Webstorm provides
        the terminal from directly within the IDE for quick access, so I should become a Git master in no time. <br><br>Like I mentioned before,
        I' will be foregoing the use of the integrated git system to really understand the inner workings of git.
        I think the term 'cookies' was a blanket term that I threw out to my mentor. I was thinking I would use it for my
        online ordering system for storing data. But I think this is wrong. In fact, I know it is. I will revisit this once I start
        building the cart to hold the items being added.
        My mentor has mentioned that I should consider using section over div. I'm brand new to div, and it makes sense to me. I do
        think there is a part on my ordering page that has 'section' in it. I can't recall why I used that. <br><br>But I also am learning, so
        knowing HTML5 over older versions of html, is basically brand new to me. But point noted.
        Other important points to take note of: -moz, -webkit and -ms properties, use of 'empsp' as a tab versus css styling,  console errors
        coming from my app page (this is actually due to the cart features popup page that I added, which I got sick around this time so wasn't
     able to fix).</p>
