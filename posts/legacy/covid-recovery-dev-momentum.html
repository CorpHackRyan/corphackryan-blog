    <h3>Sunday - Jan 02, 2022 - 22:40:30 (E.S.T.) - Third Blog Entry</h3>
    <h2>Recovering from COVID and Rebuilding My Dev Momentum</h2>
    <p>After coming down with Covid-19, I have been extremely sick the past 5 days making zero progress here on this blog
    and the website. I haven't been able to fully sit down on my computer for more than 5 minutes at times without getting aggravated
    or angry for no apparent reason. Did I mention I don't do well when I get sick? Anyway, I'm probably about 70% recovered at this
    point, and I'm really anxious to get back to work and continue my momentum on building and learning.<br><br>
    I've gone through Kwynn's <a href="https://kwynn.com/t/7/11/blog.html">Blog</a> as he's been mentoring me quite a bit on
    stuff that I've been asking him and this is sort of a list in no particular order of things that I need to either play catch
    up on, or at least complete.<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Examine the access log for Apache and analyze the hits from certain IPs. For example, if I know a particular IP is hitting me,
        I want to store that on server side and keep a counter of how many times that individual has visited my site.</li>
        <li>Understand what kwutils and kwas() is. I've got a local copy but no idea what to do. This is for future reference for myself. </li>
        <li>Coding without a debugger is NOT GOOD. I get it. I was going to write that I wasn't using console.log() as a debug tool, but now
        that I think back on it, I actually have been. Not sure how to get around this as I like to see what variables values are right away,
        and it seems the log does that fast and efficiently. But I must trust what my mentor says in that a debugger is the way to go. More
        learning to follow for sure.</li>
        <li>Regarding corporations & legal protection: I've dabbled in my own business stuff for a while. I've done my own landscaping stuff.
        I always compare it to that. If I work under myself, and do landscape work for someone, and I accidentally damage there property, I am
        held accountable. I've been under the assumption that if I ever created a company under a LLC or CORP, then I couldn't be sued for
        personal property. Just whatever assets are in the company. I like to think it's the same with a software product that I would sell
        to individuals. Regardless, I do have a few good reliable sources for small businesses. I have had them on my contact list for a couple of years
        now and basically won't be reaching out to them until the time is right. But they will be able to answer any and all questions related to
        legalities. Bottom line, I just want myself (as in, my actual assets protected) so that someone can't just take everything away because
        a bug caused their company to shut down for X amount of hours/days/weeks etc. Maybe I am paranoid, but I'd prefer to err on the side of caution.</li>
