    <h3>Tuesday - Dec 28th, 2021 - 23:10:04 (E.S.T.) - Second Blog Entry</h3>
    <h2>CSS Hover Effects, Layout Tweaks, and Mobile Questions</h2>
    <p>
    Well, that was cool. I need more data for a second blog entry to see how the styling effects each individual
    div class with respect to each other. Meaning, I need to test the margins and paddings to make sure it looks good enough
    for me to like it. I discovered a cool trick on transitioning colors linearly when the blog item is hovered over. Obviously,
    this serves no purpose here but as is with everything I'm doing with this site currently is  helping me learn more and more.
    Also, who doesn't think animation is cool??<br><br>
    Also, now that I've got a second entry in here, I can now see what they look like paired up against each other. I may adjust
    the margins a little later but for now it's just fine. Now, I can work on prettying up the blog for experimentation fun :)
    Since it's 45 minutes in, I still got 15 mins left. So I'll use that to add a picture and add some CSS styling to it.
    One thing I did notice about this text blog though - it seems that the same effect that is used on the flex-box grid seems
    to apply here to the text automatically. I don't have any display: wrap settings set in my CSS but when you resize the browser,
    the text automatically wraps and adjusts accordingly. That's pretty nifty. That makes me wonder if it does it on mobile.
        <br><br>Which leads me to the next thing that's on my mind: webdev for mobile. I'm not to concerned with it at this point as I'm
    still in the building phase and learning of web development. However, I may end up practicing with this blog when I get tired
    of banging my head trying to solve problems and use it to continue learning.
    A few other ideas I have are: adding likes, comment section. Who knows where it will take me.
   One final note, I was unable to center the image I had here within a div container. I did find a hack way to do it,
    but I was not satisfied with it. So I removed it. Not a big deal but something to revisit later. That'll do for now as my time is
    up and I am exhausted!</p>
