<h2>Debugging Git Push Failures and GitHub File Limits</h2>
<p>So in sticking with my goal of pushing daily to GitHub, I decided to push my locally hosted website as a start. I skipped using the
GitHub command line tool for the sake of time. I'm used to enabling the version control (VCS) within my IDE and then committing/pushing from
there. Never had an issue with it in the past. But for some reason, this time I did. The error that I got when attempting to push was: <br><br>
    error: RPC failed; curl 55 Failed sending data to the peer<br>
    send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet<br><br>
    So upon further inspection, I copied this error, did a quick google and the first suggestion was to switch the git config to http version 1.1,
    push, then revert to version 2. So, the command was: <br><br>
    git config --global http.version HTTP/1.1 <br>
    (push initial commit)<br>
    git config --global http.version HTTP/2 <br><br>
    But that didn't work. I still got the same error. So onto the next search. Another solution was to increase the buffer size due to the nature
    of the error, which I'm not really sure about at this point still. Maybe it's timing out, and we need to increase the timeout? But that's not what
    this command is doing. We're increasing the buffer size, so apparently something to do with size. At this point I'm thinking the packets might be to
    big that Webstorm is trying to send with git, so maybe that's why we are increasing the buffer. I don't know. Anyway, we execute the following command: <br><br>
    git config http.postBuffer 524288000<br><br>
    And what do we get? Well, we get a little further. Also, it took roughly around 60-70 seconds for this to finish, which seemed like an awful
    long time to commit just a bunch of text files. I am on a 1GBit connection, and I consistently get 40-45kb/s upstream. Anywhow,
    the error that I get is that the file 'ryans_drumming.mp4' is too large. Message I got from git cli was: <br><br>
    remote: error: File fatloss/ryan_drums.mp4 is 506.09 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB<br><br>
    Ha! I forgot I stuck a video of myself drumming in there to share with a friend. The file size was >500MB. No wonder I was getting wacky errors.
    I also learned that GitHub only supports files up to 100MB so that's interesting. Good thing to know. Anyway, after some serious issues
    trying to remove the file from the directory via the command line (I ended up specifying the new location as ~/home/krete77 instead of
    just using /home without the ~, it took me about 6-7 tries to figure that out. Now that I've removed the file, I'm still sitting here waiting
    for my push to go through. It seems to take a long time no matter what. Now, we get yet another error: <br><br>
    'Push rejected Push master to origin/master was rejected by the remote'<br>
    'refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master	[remote rejected] (pre-receive hook declined)'<br><br>
    So, after more reading, I find an issue that says that I'm trying to do a non-fast-forward push and the hooks are
    blocking it. Code suggestion to run was 'git pull --rebase' to rebase my local changes on the newest codebase.
    So, we try this and again, it failed. I've been working through this now for over 2 hours and have NEVER had this kind
    of issue when trying to push to GitHUb, so I'm going to retire and leave it for tomorrow.
