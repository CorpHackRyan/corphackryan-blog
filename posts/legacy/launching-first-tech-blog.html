    <h3>Tuesday - Dec 28th - 22:00:35 (E.S.T.) - First Blog Entry</h3>
    <h2>Launching My First Tech Blog and Learning HTML by Doing</h2>

    <p>This has been quite a fun little journey to get to this point in web development. I'm applying all the skills I have
        learned along the way over the many, many years in the past with some guidance from a good mentor who's cheering me along.
        There's nothing else I'd rather be doing right now than learning how to become a strong developer. I never for once thought
        I'd be a web developer, but it seems to be my cup of tea. Don't get me wrong, I love all sorts of programming. But with the
        way the world is today, everyone is on the cloud and needs everything at their fingertips instantaneously. Because of that,
        I've decided to capitalize on that movement and hopefully at some point down the road it will become my full time job.
    <br><br>I've decided to build this blog for many reasons. One being a place to just jot down my thoughts. I don't actually expect
        anyone to read this. But I love to journal, and I really believe that expressing your thoughts whether with classic pen/paper,
        or on computer, eventually will have a profound effect on my psyche in many positive ways. I feel it allows other parts of my brain
        to open up and allow more creativity and understanding to flow through.
    <br><br>The other main reason for this is to just practice my html skills in building a blog site. I have I think enough experience now
        to code this thing from scratch, including the CSS styling, which is what I really am going for. I told my mentor that I would
        be able to build this in under an hour. I think I'm about 20 minutes in right now. So I've got the data here. I've also created
        a /div id for each blog entry. I'm using the /p tag to separate these paragraphs. I will now hunt down some generic image for the top,
        apply some cool background effects and apply styling to the p tags & div tags to my liking. Let's see how it goes. In addition,
        I just learned how to insert TABs into the paragraph using the & emsp; command.
    <br><br>One last entry here - I am close to where I wanted to get it. However, I ran into some weird bug where my changes were not
        being reflected in the browser from my CSS styling. I ended up creating a new div, and individually copying each paragraph
        as I went along and checked each one to ensure the styling were being applied. There is literally NO difference between what I have
        coded now and what I had coded previously. However, it is working now. Not sure what the issue was. </p>
