    <h3>Tuesday - February 08, 2022 - 20:13:02 (E.S.T.) - Fifth Blog Entry</h3>
    <h2>MariaDB Fundamentals, AWS Study, and Project Pressure</h2>
    <p>It has been a good while since I've updated this blog. Kind of not happy about it but I have made a lot of progress since I last
    made an update. Lately, I've been working on learning MariaDB (mySQL) and the entry level stuff that goes along with it. I messed around
    in the shell and learned how to create & delete logins, assign passwords, the use of privileges, create/delete tables, various sql execution statements such as
    select, and also how to join tables with a query. I also installed mySQL Workbench, and even though it's a bit buggy, it has given me some deeper understanding
    of database administration on the front end. I'm pleased with my progress. <br><br> I've also been scouring craigslist for computer gigs for my mentor and myself, and I'm
    getting close to thinking about tackling a project. It's not that I'm afraid to do it, I just dont need anymore added pressure at this time, so being under the
    gun for an additional project at this time in my life isn't to smart. The flip side of that is, I'm learning new technologies and growing as a developer, and I think
    to really improve on what I'm learning, I need to step it up and see a project through to completion. I do have 3 ongoing personal projects right now which I'm more
    than ever motivated to do, even if I'm making slow progress. Progress is progress.
    <br><br>
    I also learned there's a Github command line tool today, which I hadn't know about previously. But of course there is. There's a cli tool for everything the deeper I go.
    I'm very pleased with that actually. I haven't had any luck getting it to work but I also didn't put much effort into it.
    <br><br>
    Other things I've been working through is AWS Cloud Practitioner course. I have the certification exam coming up next week. I've passed some of the trial exams, so we'll
        see how I do there. I'm loving Cloud Academy right now. I'm very comfortable moving around the AWS console - creating EC2 instances, implementing DynamoDB, Billing,
        Cloudwatch, Lamdba, API Gateway, S3. It's a hell of a beast and I've only scratched the surface. I'm currently taking the Architect solutions class right now,
        and will be going into SySOPS after that. I think I finish out the year with Developer (sometime in September). <br><br>It's exhausting to say the least but once I'm done
        I think I'll be a well rounded individual with tech. I'm still trying to find my passion though where I can work every day in the tech world and be stimulated and
        not bored, and also enjoy what I'm doing every day. Time will reveal that to me soon enough. I have no doubts whatsoever.
