<h2>React Tutorials, Linux Setup Hurdles, and Career Momentum</h2>
<p>Whoa it's been almost 2 months since I posted an entry in here. I've been fairly active according to my <a href="https://github.com/corphackryan">GitHUb</a>. So, let's see, since my
last push here on this site I've worked on a tutorial for building a tic-tac-toe game in React, a take home assessment for Oracle building a GUI app in Java Swing, some PHP coding around
JSON files, experimenting with Jupyter notebook and learning about all the wonderful features of NumPy.<br><br>Guess I'll start with React. I'm following a few different tutorials that
I've found online. It seems like everywhere I look when applying to jobs has some sort of React involved in it. So I figured why not, let's get some exposure to it. I do have a goal in mind
to eventually change this page over into React. It probably doesn't make much sense to do that but for learning purposes, that's why I'd be doing it. I have probably only spent about 4 hours
total from getting the stuff required to get it running installed to having a working app. Setup and configuration seemed ok. I ran into some issues installing node.js on my system but a
few quick google searches I was able to overcome all of the minor issues. Being on linux certainly is a little more challenging when installing software compared to Windows. You don't just
double click an .exe file, choose a path and voila! Successful install of said application. No, it's definitely a little more complicated than that. I find myself struggling with path stuff in
linux. I'm about 15 months into using Linux full time as my primary OS, and while I'd never go back to Windows, I still find myself having to researching how to do things quite a bit. That was
the whole point actually in making the switch - to force myself to learn how to navigate linux - and I'm still way behind the curve. But,
