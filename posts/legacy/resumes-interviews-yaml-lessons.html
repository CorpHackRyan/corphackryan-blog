    <h2>Resumes, Interviews, and CSV/XLSX-to-YAML Lessons</h2>
    <p>Wow time flies. It's been a few weeks since I have been able to make an update here. First, I'll just say where I've been spending most of my time. Mostly I've been working
    in Python experimenting with different libraries and analyzing data. I have also been applying extensively to software developer positions. I took some  time, actually I paid for
    a resume creation service called BeamJobs and they are 100% worth it. I've already had a few interviews in the last 2 weeks from this resume alone. Granted, I had to revamp my
    entire resume and remove the last 8 years of jobs since they didn't have anything to do with software development. So I had to get creative. Anyway, the service is super easy to
    use and creates a professional looking resume in minutes. If you want to see what it looks like, you can check mine out <a href="../../assets/RyanOConnor_resume.pdf">here.</a> I can't
    promise this will be updated in the future as I'll probably forget this hyper link exists as time goes on.<br><br>
    So two of the companies I interviewed for gave me take home assignments. One assignment is a very complicated assignment which doesn't have a deadline. It's for a pretty high profile
    firm who works for the government and handles ciphers, encryption and steganography. I had put it on the back burner temporarily waiting to get some free time. However, a second
    company I spoke with gave me a simpler task which took roughly ~9 hours over 8 days. I chipped away at it little by little. The goal of the task was to take some given datasets, whether
    they be in <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/348960/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-do-i-open-it/">CSV</a> or <a href="https://www.canto.com/blog/xlsx-document-file/">XLSX</a>
    format, and convert them to <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml">YAML</a> format. I've done this sort of stuff before. In fact, it was taking CSV files and
    converting them into <a href="https://opensource.com/article/21/7/what-xml">XML</a> documents. You can see my source code <a href="https://github.com/CorpHackRyan/PoppuluTask/blob/master/main.py">here</a> on how I did that.
    Actually, this particular task had a really cool feature in it - I had to embed a base64 encoded file into the actual XML document itself. Anyway, back to the other task regarding
    converting CSV/XLSX to YAML.<br><br>
    I ended up going way over scope on this task. Mainly because I like to seek out as many edge cases as possible and then learn how to make sure they are
    covered. A few different cases I came up with was ensuring the passed in 2 arguments from the command line. If it was less than 2, then program execution would halt. If a user
    did pass 2 arguments, then I would check both paths to ensure they existed in the system. If they didn't, execution would halt. I used the csv reader library that's native to Python
    to parse the CSV files. It's a little more difficult than using pandas which is why I chose to do it. I was trying to keep the script light weight. However, to parse the XLSX input
    required an additional library that's not native to Python, called <a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">openpyxl</a>. I've used this before so I had some familiarity with
    it. Again, I could have used pandas and probably simplified the entire process but I like to make my own life difficult for learning sake. <br><br>
    I have taken a breather from doing any more web development, just mainly because my free time is limited. I think though, between doing this cipher/steganography assignment and potentially
    making this site a little prettier, I should be able to commit some more time relatively soon. I did get the mariaDB database finally working. That was fun trying to diagnose why I couldn't
    connect to my mariaDB server via PHP. Come to find out, I needed to actually renamed this website's extension to .php from .html. I guess there's a way to get the .html to have PHP code
    executed inside it but it wasn't worth trying to figure that out since literally changing the extension allowed the connection to my server to work.
