    <h2>SQL Workbench, Python File Scans, and Regex Extraction</h2>
    <p>I am becoming  very comfortable with moving between programming languages now. I was programming a lot of HTML/CSS for a while, then moved back into Python. I'm becoming
    somewhat competent now in setting up the different environments for each language. It's pretty exciting actually. I was doing a lot of SQL work last week.  I actually had
    mySQL workbench installed a couple months ago as recommended by a mentor, but hadn't actually used it extensively until recently. After having gone through a week long mySQL fundamentals class now,
    I'm happy to report how awesome this app actually is. I love how it lets me execute SQL queries and displays graphically what I'm executing. Normally, I'd have to either print
    out the results or manually run SELECT statements within the mariaDB shell. <br><br>
    Anyhow, I just finished up a Python side project for a company. I can't really talk about what it's about
    in details, but  I can talk about some of the different methods I've been using. First one is OS.walk(). This function let's you traverse through unlimited (well, I believe it's unlimited)
    amounts of directories, within sub directories until it gets to the  lowest directory. Once I get to the lowest  directory, I'm seeking out any file that's a Ruby (*.rb) file. Once found,
    I'm adding to a list to return to my main function. I then pass that list off to another function which will process all of the Ruby files it found in the system. Here, I bring in
    the regular expression library, and seek through each file scraping for any data that's contained between quotation marks or apostrophes (' or  ""). I just run a for loop to iterate through
    the file list, then another for loop to read each file, then read in each line and apply: re.findall(r"['\"](.*?)['\"]", index). I just run a if statement on whether what's returned is
    'None' or a  match is found. If match is found, then we add append this data to a newly created list which contains all matches found.<br><br>
    Once I have a traversed through all folders and files,  and scraped each file line by line for specific data, I then do a set() difference between two lists. The first list I'm using
    is the one I built from all the Ruby files, and the other list I'm using is a list built from a CSV file which contains particular data of interest. Long story short, I do a set difference
    between the two, and whatever is missing from the Ruby files that doesn't exist in the list built from the CSV file, I then return back that final set of data. This is the data that will
    be used for reporting which security measures are missing from the system. This was a really fun project! It was estimated to take around 8 hours total and I ended up taking around 16.75 hours
    to complete it. <br><br>
    I have two other projects that I'm working on right now as well. One isn't that interesting so I won't bother going into it. But the other is a take home technical assessment which I'm having
    to build in Java. The scope is to use the <a href="https://openaq.org/#/">OpenAQ</a> API to send requests and retrieve the results. Once the results have been retrieved, store them in some
    sort of data structure that can be used to pass off to a front-end developer who will then be able to write to code to process that data to generate a heat map. I've actually got the API
    requests working, and receiving the data back and storing them in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3222851/what-is-json-a-better-format-for-data-exchange.html">JSON</a> format. Let me tell you,
    parsing JSON data in Java is a huge technical pain compared to Python. It's night and day. I'd say what takes 4-6 lines in Java to parse JSON can be done done in 1-2 lines in Python. And it's much cleaner
    looking in Python in my opinion. Maybe I'm just Python biased, but I really think for this type of solution, Python is the clear winner.
